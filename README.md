## How It Works

1. **Campaign Creation**: A user can create a crowdfunding campaign by specifying a goal and a deadline (block height).
2. **Contributions**: Contributors can send STX to active campaigns until the deadline.
3. **Claiming Funds**: If the funding goal is met, the campaign owner can claim the raised funds.
4. **Refunds**: If a campaign fails to meet its goal before the deadline, contributors can refund their STX.
5. **Campaign Lifecycle Management**: Campaigns can be updated, canceled (if no funds), and queried for status and history.
